The project can be found in the Course Project folder. 
It can be compiled with the following steps:

2. Open MyTodoList in Android Studio
3. Run the application from the play button

The Course Work folder holds all the exercise projects. They can be compiled by following the same steps as the course projects.
Just make sure to open the right project. They are named Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3 each representing the video of the same name.

In addition, there are the learning diary and a file with a link to the video of the project running.
